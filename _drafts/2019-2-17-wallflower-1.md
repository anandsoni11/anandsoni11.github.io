## Finding someone
It is a universally known fact that humans are social animals. A lot of things happen in our lives everyday. The innate human need to socialize and share drive each one of us to find and be with people. People who we trust and who trust us back. People who understand us. People who stand by our side. People who've got our backs. Friends. If we dig deep, there is hardly a human being who wants to go it alone. All of us need friend(s). And even when we think that we can go all alone, that we can be lone wolves, there are times in life when having a shoulder to cry upon or just a hand to hold gives us enormous hope, strength and the right perspective towards life. 

Like any of us, I have been on a quest to find true friendship in life. Even a person like me (introvert, socializes the least, has only one or two close friends and whatever else the world says about me), at this juncture of life, understands well the importance of friendship and the vitality of this quest to find one. I like to believe that I did find someone who I share everything with, who knows the kind of person I am and who I have trusted as much as I trust myself. 

Its a tricky thing. Friendship. Even hard sometimes. Unlike people who socialize a lot (the so called extroverts), friendship to me is a very serious matter. Reason? When you have only one (or two) close friend(s) and not an array of "friends" to be with, you realize how important that friendship is in your life. You are closer to them than you are to anybody else. The level of emotional connect is usually high. And before you realize, they become your family. Now, friendship has its own bright and dark moments. Friends laugh together, share things, share stories and emotions, fight with each other, get mad at each other, cry together, work together and with some extreme luck live together. But, whatever they do, if the friendship is true, friends never really part. Friends are forever, indeed. 
 

## The third wheel of friendship
As I said, friendship is tricky and hard. 
 

## With friends but alone

 

## The vociferous silence

 

## The scare of loss and the desperate need to change

 

## When all that is wrong with the world is you, how do you change yourself?

 

## Finding someone again
