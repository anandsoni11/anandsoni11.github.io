## Finding someone
It is a universally known fact that humans are social animals. A lot of things happen in our lives everyday. The innate human need to socialize and share drive each one of us to find and be with people. People who we trust and who trust us back. People who understand us. People who stand by our side. People who've got our backs. Friends. If we dig deep, there is hardly a human being who wants to go it alone. All of us need friend(s). And even when we think that we can go all alone, that we can be lone wolves, there are times in life when having a shoulder to cry upon or just a hand to hold gives us enormous hope, strength and the right perspective towards life. 

Like any of us, I have been on a quest to find true friendship in life. Even a person like me (introvert, socializes the least, has only one or two close friends and whatever else the world says about me), at this juncture of life, understands well the importance of friendship and the vitality of this quest to find one. I like to believe that I did find someone who I share everything with, who knows the kind of person I am and who I have trusted as much as I trust myself. Maybe more.

Its a tricky thing. Friendship. Even hard sometimes. Unlike people who socialize a lot (the so called extroverts), friendship to me is a very serious matter. Reason? When you have only one (or two) close friend(s) and not an array of "friends" to be with, you realize how important that friendship is in your life. You are closer to them than you are to anybody else. The level of emotional connect is usually high. And before you realize, they become your family. Now, friendship has its own bright and dark moments. Friends laugh together, share things, share stories and emotions, fight with each other, get mad at each other, cry together, work together and with some extreme luck live together. But, whatever they do, if the friendship is true, friends never really part. Friends are forever, indeed. 

## Found (the third wheel of) friendship?
As I said, friendship is tricky. Sometimes hard. One of the instances when it gets really tough is when you become a third wheel. Imagine a scenario where you become close friend to one or both of two best friends. Since you are new to the group (and you always will be), more often than not, you may feel like a third wheel. A third wheel is a friend who is not vital to making plans or even making conversations. A third wheel is mostly the last informed, hardly consulted and dispensable friend of the group. From a personal experience, this is the hardest friendship scenario. It can be emotionally taxing and exhausting. Now, add to this the fact that you (the third wheel) are also an introvert and have hardly any other friend(s). Bam! You have the perfect cocktail and you are in for an emotional roller coaster ride.

Now, having already stressed on the vitality of friendship, I must also say that in today's world where recklessness has taken over emotions, some people are holding even more tightly to the gift of friendship that they have in life. It is truly said : 

> In this crazy world that we live in friendship is indeed the best of virtues.

Talk about virtues? Well, lets not. Maybe sometime else. So, you are a third wheel and even then you most definitely want to continue? Great! Not everyone has the endurance and the strength to do that. Well then. Let's dig in more and talk about a few hard experiences. A few lessons learnt. 

## With friends but alone
 Being alone is not bad. It is tough though. And as we progress into the modern world, our society has turned more and more into a judgmental body. Being alone is tantamount to being different and being different means that you don't "fit" into our society's scheme. And all that results in a feeling of discomfort and of course, in some extreme cases, a stigma is attached to your personality. Once again, you realize how important true friends are, in life!

But, what if you have friends and you still feel alone? Let's go back to our third wheel scenario. What if the people who you consider your best friends hardly notice you? What if your presence isn't noticed and your absence isn't felt? You are always with them but they are hardly ever with you. Nothing in the world can make you feel lonelier than that. Sometimes, it so happens in life that a friendship (or any relationship for that matter) reaches the peak of its beauty and then somehow, somewhere things go wrong. But, it doesn't mean that we should give up. There are some people so beautiful in our lives that being with them is worth all the pain that it might bring to us! There is a quote that I am reminded of :

> You will be shocked to discover how easy it is in life to part ways with people forever. That's why, when you find someone you want to keep around, you do something about it.

## The vociferous silence
It has been the story of my life so far that my silent nature has always kept me misunderstood. It is said that quiet people have the loudest minds. Honestly, I don't know what that means really. If it means that quiet people overthink their lives, then yes I can relate. I overthink. And when anyone overthinks, they complicate even the simplest things in life. They usually find themselves hesitant to do "things". I find it hard to strike and start conversations with people. Even with the best and closest of my friends. Now, does this mean that quiet people don't have things to say? Not really. Quiet people can have very strong opinions on things that matter the most in life. You will usually find them being silent and reluctant for small talk. But, strike a philosophical conversation (any conversation that excites them) and you will find how much they think about life and how vociferous a silent person can be.

Having said that, lets talk about friendship again. Sometimes, even your best friends will find it hard to accept the quiet and silent you. And they are not to be blamed. When you don't speak much, it is very hard for anyone (closeness is irrelevant here) to figure you out. Its very hard to figure out what's going on inside that head of yours. A good friend will try to keep up with you and accept you for as long as he/she can. But, there comes a time when even the best of the best give up (on you!). Personally, I have had altercations with my best friend about the way I am. And sometimes, when no one in the world understands the vociferous silence inside you, you are left all alone. And, truly speaking, its a scary experience. And since you overthink, you reach a point where you see yourself as your own enemy. You see yourself as the reason why nobody wants to stay in your life. Why nobody wants you! My friend, a word of advice, never hate yourself for what you are. The key to happiness is to accept yourself first and then discover yourself in the friends that you make. Accept yourself.

## The scare of loss and the desperate need to change
Friendship can work in mysterious ways. Just like life constantly teaches you things in unexpected ways, friendship teaches you in its own unique ways. Sometimes, you make friends that become indispensable in life. You just can't imagine your life without them and hence the thought of losing them becomes nightmarish. Now, imagine a heated altercation with your best friend. The scenario : you speak so little, you hardly socialize with anyone else and your friend is mighty pissed off at you for that behavior/nature of yours. The words that got exchanged include phrases like : *you need to introspect*, *what will you do if I am not there from tomorrow*, *you are upset 365 days a year*, *I will never initiate conversations with you if you don't change* and so on. Anyone else telling you those things can be easily ignored. But, when that comes from someone who means everything to you then it hurts. A lot. 

And after all that, you begin thinking. You think that something is wrong with you. Even your best friend can't bear with you and doesn't want you anymore. You get scared that you might lose him/her. And, inadvertently, you begin that introspection and ask yourself this : what's so wrong with me that I am unloveable and unpleasant to this extreme? And in no time, you figure that you will be desperate if you don't try to change yourself. You will lose everything that holds dear in your life. Guess what, maybe you have already lost. 

But as the saying goes : 

> If you don't like where you are, move. You are not a tree.

And that's what you decide to do. By this point, the world has already hurt you so much that instead of driving closer to the world, you indulge into isolation. You speak even less and when you look around, the world and everyone that you hold dear in it looks happier without you. Effectively, what started as a process to change yourself into a "better", talkative person, has already turned into a realization that everyone has let go of you and so should you. Sometimes, the world is better with you in it and sometimes without. Sometimes, the happiness of people you love is primary and yours, of course, secondary. So, give the world what it wants from you. Spread more smiles!

## When all that is wrong with the world is you, how do you change yourself?
 Okay, let me contradict myself a bit here. Not everyone that sets on the journey to change and become "better" gives up and enters into isolation. No! There are people who try and hold on with the hope that one day, things will change and one day they will again be eligible and worthy of that friendship they lost. But, again, how do you change? Where do you even begin? Because when you begin, the world has convinced you that you are what is wrong with it! Here, I am reminded of a quote that I came up with :

> It is always an uphill battle. The one that you fight against yourself.

Why is it always uphill? Because you always rise! In an effort to become a changed and better human being, you fight yourself and you rise. Or so the world sees it. Ultimately, in both cases : changing yourself or letting go, you end up giving the word exactly what it wants. The world wins either ways! Food for thought : when it all ends, who wins and who loses when you are fighting against yourself?

In an ideal world though (where you are allowed to be happy no matter how less you talk), you should never believe the world and you should never try to change what you are. Be yourself! That's one of the most cliched phrases ever but, may be it has some truth to it. If you can be yourself, then you don't have to worry about the question : *where do I even begin?* Utopian thought? 

## Finding someone again
So here we are! You feel lonely, find someone, get left alone and life comes back full circle. When you have true feelings for someone (a friend, love, family), losing them is one of the hardest things to go through in life. But, it gets worse. It gets worse when you lose them because they reject you and leave you alone. Yes, and evidently, nothing hurts emotionally more than that. Trust me. So, the question is how do you begin ***again***? 

Do you have the strength to find someone again? Will you ever feel like getting so close to someone again? There is no simple answer. Sometimes, you just meet eyes with someone and know that things are going to work out. All other times, you have to work hard to make things work. Now, you can't keep waiting to meet someone magically. Everything that you do in life needs work. But, again, friends and friendship are supposed to make life a little bit easier and not tougher than it was without them. I believe friendship should be easy on some levels. It has to be natural. If there is a constant fear of losing someone, constant hard work to remain friends with someone and constant gloominess then it is not worth it to hang on to that. Now, it is much easier said than done. Especially, if you are an emotional and ethical person, it is hard to let go of someone who you got very close to. Just like you never turn your back to family, you can't turn your back to your closest friends and allies even when they do. No doubt, it can make life an unpleasant experience for you. But again, what is life without harsh and devastating experiences?
