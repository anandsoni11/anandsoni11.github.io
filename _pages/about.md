<p>*Thought. Insights. Life lessons.* was started by me *(Anand Soni)* back in 2016. Since then, it has gone through many changes and iterations.  Started as a personal blog, it was meant to be creative vent to all my thoughts and everything that life teaches every now and then.</p>

<p>As a technologist, I have always been a believer in the power of open source and collaboration. And now, I am convinced that this blog needs to be open sourced as well. I have a vision to develop *Thought. Insights. Life lessons.* as a global platform where people all across the world can come, share their thoughts and insights about life (or anything that has the potential to *teach* the reader) and also learn from others' life experiences.</p>

<p>To bring this vision to reality, I need help. Your help. If you feel even a little inspired by the contents on this blog and if there is a little nudge inside you to share and teach, I invite you to share this widely and contribute!</p>

<p>If you would like to write here, please get in touch with me. Send me an <a href = "mailto: anand.92.soni@gmail.com">email</a> with a text draft of your thoughts and I will make sure they are published soon.</p>

<p>A few topic suggestions that you can write about : General life lessons, Productivity, Introversion and personality types, Entrepreneurship, Leadership, Technology. If you have anything that doesn't fall into the above categories, send it to me anyway!</p>

<p>Together, let's create a better world.</p>
