Don't many of us waste time in indecision rather than acting on our ideas? Yes, *think before you do* is good but prolonged thinking and resulting inaction severely hurt our chances at success in life. Why do we keep vacillating then? Why is it so hard to be decisive? Simply put, it's because it takes a lot of courage to decide and get moving. More often than not, people enjoy the luxury of being in their comfort zones. A lot of decisions in life never see the light of the day just because being decisive is not comfortable.

Truth being spoken, almost all of us, at some point in our lives are vexed by our subconscious (conscience, soul, mind call it whatever suits you) to go after something. Something that forms a part of our deepest desires in life. It may be about career or relationship or self-improvement or anything else that makes us dream with our eyes open. But, how many of us actually act on it? In my experience, a select few. And that's because of our fears, social insecurities and the insatiable thirst for comfort.

So, how do we overcome ourselves? Before getting into the *how*, let's start with the *why*.

### **The need to be courageous**
It's always hard to dare. And it's always scary to go out and do things that are not comfortable. But, if only life was about sitting in a chair and sipping coffee all the time, we wouldn't have the need or the necessity to be courageous. What is courage anyway? Someone has rightly said that *courage is not the absence of fear, it is the ability to do things despite being afraid.* So, really, each of us, at some time, have to be courageous enough to *decide* and take the necessary steps towards progress in life. Nothing worthwhile is ever achieved if we can't find the courage to pursue it.

>> You can choose courage, or you can choose comfort, but you cannot choose both.

### **The need to learn and improvise**
Just like stagnant water is a breeding ground for bacteria and parasites, stagnation, in life, is a breeding ground for negativity and depression. We live better when we keep improving and when we keep learning. The urge to learn is inspired in many ways. Some people naturally are inclined towards continuous learning. Others learn from their mistakes and failures. But, if we can't *decide* to do *(something)*, how will we make any mistakes at all? And if there are no mistakes, learning is limited to what we hear from others. While, that may work for some, it usually isn't effective for improvement. Learning from personal experiences helps us improve and improvise.

>> Failure is instructive. The person who really thinks, learns quite as much from his failures as from his successes.

### **The need to gain self-respect and confidence**
People, in today's world, find it easy to lose themselves in the opinions and perceptions of others. The moment you are born, the process of conditioning begins and it never stops. But, we all need to learn to make decisions. On our own. Despite opinions. Despite perceptions. And that is possible only when there is a touch of immense confidence in what we do and when we respect what we are and why we do what we do. Being *decisive* feeds self-confidence and self-confidence, in turn, feeds our ability to make better decisions.

>> To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

### **The need to embrace failures**
One of the worst ailments of our society is the fear of failure. Failures are still looked down upon and there is nothing more ridiculous than that. Failures are life experiences. *A frog in a well can not discuss the ocean.* Apt. Whatever success means to each of us, individually, we can never achieve it if we never try to get out of our wells. And when we decide to get out of the well, into the real world, we try things, we utilise our talent, we make mistakes and we fail. But, what we fail to realise is that each failure builds a step on which we climb up and out. Failures lead to learning, learning makes us better and when we become better, we move closer to success. But, how can we ever climb out of our *wells* if we don't even *decide* to?

>> Why do we fall? So we can learn to pick ourselves up.

### **The need to really succeed**
Whenever I am alone and idle, I always end up asking myself the same questions : *What is the purpose of my life? Why am I here?* Society can be very narrow and orthodox in defining success. And that's why the onus to define our own success lies on us. A good education, a well paying job, a lavish lifestyle; while all these can define one's success in the society and may help one to rise in the social ranks, they may not necessarily define success for the rest. And this idea, no matter how obvious to me and you, is not easily comprehensible to many of us. And in order to realise that *you define your own success*, you need to learn the art of decision making and the virtue of being decisive. Inconclusive vascillation only poisons our capability to unleash our potential and ultimately harms our chances to find value in life.

>> Try not to become a person of success, but rather try to become a person of value.

If we really think about it, being decisive, making mistakes, failing, gaining strength, failing more and ultimately succeeding are all steps in a single process. And that process triggers only when we decide to be decisive. Until then, we haven't even taken the first step to what success means in our life. All of us can develop the strength of decision but only if we start. As Arnold Schwarzenegger once said -

>> Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength.

And now, I pass the ball to your court. Decide. Now.
