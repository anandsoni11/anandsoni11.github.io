Recently, my brother decided to buy a new phone and I suggested him to get the Apple iPhone XR. Without much delay, he got it. While setting up, he enquired about his data. How all his contacts, messages and photos will transfer. And I had but one answer. Everything is going to sync! And if everything had synced, I would probably not be writing this today.

He signed in to his Google account on the iPhone and Murphy's law came into effect. All the data didn't copy to the iPhone. As he found out, sync on his Android phone was disabled for a long time. So, most of his contacts were gone, photos were gone. His WhatsApp messages were gone. And by this time, with his old phone already given away, it felt like a part of his existence had went missing. Just like that!

This little incident coaxed me into looking for everything around that connects us to the world. And all I could see was the internet, the devices and the applications (apps, colloquially). Today, our devices and apps are the way we perceive most of the world. Take away the devices and we immediately feel handicapped.

Personally, I am a staunch believer in technological advance. But, there are always two sides to a coin and we should never be too chauvinistic to ignore the one that we like less. Technology has made life much easier and more connected than ever before. And it has also led to a paradigm shift in the way we see the world and the way the world sees us. Let me elaborate, categorically, how. The intent is to debunk some myths around the role of technology in taking away the good old days and then to finally shed some light on things that we might want to change.

### **Communication in the modern age**

A few days back, I started writing about modern communication. A new way, for the most part of which, the choice of words is not really relevant and the emotions can be missing (or hard to convey). Chats. The biggest advantages of chats (text messages) are convenience, security and instantaneity. Of course, there can be a whole debate on the security aspect. Some people say that we have lost the ability to express emotions through words because of this instantaneity. We receive texts and without thinking, send a reply. We prefer speed in communication over thoughtfulness. And of course, we blame technology for this change.

But, if we really think about it, the very purpose of chats is to obliviate the pain of waiting. Their purpose was never to establish deeper bonds. There are things that can't wait and there are times when we need instant gratification. That's why we use chats! Now, there is nothing that stops us from being penmen from time to time. For instance, I constantly write letters. To people who are close to me. To convey my deep thoughts.  And I use both - digital media and the good old paper to write. So, in essence, yes technology has changed the way we communicate but does that mean we see it as requisite? Why not look at it as a powerful option in our armoury of words?

### **Friendships and Relationships**

Right, this one is going to roll some eyes! Ever had a dinner with family or friends where you look around and all eyes are on respective phones/<other devices>? Sounds familiar? Well, I have had. And when it comes to friends and family, I like to take a more conservative and orthodox approach to the use of technology. Anyway, that's not the point I am making here. It's an individual choice.

In today's world, the definition of friendship remains the same but the way we perceive it has changed. Talk about friends and immediately an image of Facebook takes shape in the mind. How many friends do you have on Facebook? Hundreds? Thousands even? That is unrealistic. Someone once said to me - When dying, if you can confidently say that you made five true friends while you lived, your life was a success. This may sound a tad too extreme but, the truth is friendship is hard work. It takes time. And you know what, it is unbelievably easy to lose connection with people. And that's exactly the problem that platforms like Facebook have solved. These platforms are social networks. They connect people. We are social animals and being in a group makes us feel safe. That's why we network. That's why we use Facebook. To stay in the group. To stay connected. It doesn't mean that everyone you connect to on such platforms becomes a friend.

Again, it's not technology, it's us. While using these platforms, we changed the perception. We think that technology has made us robotic about friendships. But, the truth is, we use the technology without comprehending its purpose. Why not see friends as friends and connections as connections (both important in their own ways)?

Let's move to relationships. Digital dating is a thing now. There has been a steep rise in the usage and development of dating and matrimonial apps over the past few years. Ever used Tinder? As they say, swipe left, swipe right, done! Finding and then physically meeting people takes a lot of work, a lot of energy and a lot of time. Once again, technology came to rescue. Apps like Tinder give us a chance to make a first impression before a first appearance. On similar concept, most of the matrimonial platforms work.

Digital dating platforms and apps don't take away the thrill of meeting someone. They give you an easy head start. Technology doesn't make you a relationship, it provides the initial impetus that many people need to start looking for one. It's again up to us to decide how we perceive it.

### **Education**

School education is changing. I remember the school that I went to. It was in the late 90s. We used to have few good teachers who were passionate about shaping young minds. But, we had no or minimal infrastructure necessary for a holistic development. In fact, education (in schools) was merely rote learning of books, getting good marks (yes grades was still a futuristic concept) and moving to the next standard. I guess, rational thinking, technological awareness and concept formation were never the aims of primary education. When I went on for higher education to Mumbai, it was the first exposure to the modern (and real) world that I got in 18 years of my life. That's when technology showed up before me!

And where are we today? Yes, there is still a lot of work to be done in this area and that's where technology has once again proved it's essence. E-learning and remote learning has picked up a lot of pace. There are efforts going on (as experiments) to introduce smart classrooms in schools. They leverage on the ability of kids to grab better with audio/visual aids that help them in better concept formation. In a way, it also brings them to speed with the technology of their times. Today, the kids don't have to wait for exposure to technology. They grow up in an environment where devices surround them and the internet gives them an easy access to the world that the previous generations never had. At home and now increasingly, in schools.

The problem with primitive teaching methods was singular. Rote learning. The question, essentially, was why were we just reading and memorising concepts when we could utilise our other senses to learn much better? And the answer came with the aid of technology.

### **Work and jobs**

The digital revolution, as it should be called, has made its way through all facets of our lives. And that includes the work we do and the workplaces where we do it in. Being a software engineer, technology forms the most basic part of my work. So, I will not talk about that. Let's talk about automation.

The use of robotic automation in industries has been on rise for the last few years. It takes away mundane tasks and increases productivity. And this does mean that some jobs, with increasing emphasis on automation, are becoming obsolete. And that's where the importance of education increases a lot. For the first time in human history, we have the opportunity to upskill, be technology aware and contribute more to tasks which require the abilities that only humans have. Technology may completely replace production lines and offer solutions to a variety of industrial problems but, we will always need humans to strategise those solutions (and yes, I say this knowing very well the rise of Artificial Intelligence).

With the increasing reach of technology to customers (who may or may not be technically equipped), the importance of communication will increase. Jobs taken away with automation will lead to opportunities in areas like customer service, call centres, human contact et al. Jobs that require passion, creativity, emotional intelligence and relationship management. I think, the impact of automation on these jobs will be the least.

All in all, we have vast opportunities for better education and improving human skills like never before. Undoubtedly, it is going to take a lot of collective efforts. I understand if people see this as being too optimistic but, we need to embrace (and not blame) the technological advances here.

### **The alter ego**

Today, there are around 17 billion devices connected to the internet (Internet of Things or IoT). There is an unprecedented flow and exchange of information across the world. And these connected devices indeed form a world wide web of information. A lot has been said about technology. But, on a philosophical level, how have all these advancements changed us or impacted us as humans?

If we honestly think about it, we will realise that we have been indulging a lot in the devices that surround us on a second to second basis. And it would be fair to accept that our abilities to form trust based relationships, to be creative, to experience world though our own senses, to soak in the energy of nature have diminished to certain extent.

There is a whole generation alive who has never experienced the ecstasy of pouring their hearts out on a paper. Many of us don't experience the bewilderment of approaching a stranger, establishing trust, being vulnerable, becoming true friends anymore. A lot of us are too busy with the social network and our devices that we hardly give attention to the actual human network waiting for interaction.

What we do know is the excitement and the dopamine rush we get when our smartphone beeps, makes a noise or flashes a light. It notifies us. It tells us that someone just digitally remembered us or showed a liking for us. And subconsciously, we wait for that sound, for that beep and for that flash.

What this means is there is a digital version of us doing rounds around the world riding on the IoT (the internet being the medium, like the road). And this digital version, what I like to call our digital alter ego, may or may not truly represent us. In most cases (personal opinion) I think, it doesn't. The real me or the real you can be a lot different from what appears on the internet. So, what do we do differently?

Balance is key. Holding off technological advances just to feel the way we used to feel before is not progressive thought. To reiterate, we all should be able to appreciate the need to be scientifically and technologically advanced. We can't be primitive again just to discover the thrill of making fire from flint stones! No. What we need to do is find ways to keep alive our innate abilities to live without the help of technology. It can be through a hobby or any activity that makes us feel connected to our natural selves. But, it is essential that we, the creators of technology, do not lose ourselves into it so much that we forget what we were originally. And that responsibility lies solely with us.
