I happened to read George Eliot's *A mill on the Floss* recently. Basically, a bildungsroman woven beautifully around the protagonist's life, her transition into adulthood and the many emotional hardships that she goes through in the process. I stumbled upon the following excerpts from the book -

>> ..Prejudices come as the natural food of tendencies which can get no sustenance out of that complex, fragmentary, doubt-provoking knowledge which we call truth…

>> Let a prejudice be bequeathed, carried in the air, adopted by hearsay, caught in through the eye, - however, it may come, these minds will give it a habitation; it is something to assert strongly and bravely, something to fill up the void of spontaneous ideas, something to impose on others with the authority of conscious right; it is at once a staff and a baton. Every prejudice that will answer these purposes is self-evident.

While there is some context in the book as to when these lines were elicited, I will save you from that trouble and get straight to the point.

Sometimes, a lot that we do in life and believe (about ourselves) is a result of what others think of us and our abilities. And, from personal experience, a lot that others believe about us may or may not be based on truth backed up by data or facts. A lot of those beliefs may be based on perceptions as well as prejudices, both of which, as Eliot says, get no sustenance from truth.

And that brings me to the idea of knowing our own worth. Self-worth. What we inherently are must not change due to perceptions and prejudices. A lot of originality that is lost from the world, one can safely attribute to reading too much into others' perceptions and not realizing our own abilities and potential.

But, how do we preserve self-worth in a world that may constantly try to mould us in its own specific ways?


### **What is self-worth anyway?**
Self-worth is the sense of one's own value as a person. But, how important are external factors and judgements to this sense of value? Not at all. Self-worth is not  about measuring yourself based on external actions but, it is about valuing your inherent worth as a person.


### **A parable and a lesson**
>> Once a young man came to a wise man and said, "I've come to you because I feel so worthless that I don't want to live anymore. Everyone around me says that I'm a failure and a fool. I'm begging you, please help me!"
>> The wise man glanced at him and hurriedly answered, "I'm sorry, but I'm very busy now and can't possibly help you. I have an urgent matter to take care of…." he stopped for a moment, thinking, then added, "But if you agree to help me get this done, then I will gladly help you afterwards."
>> "Of…of course," murmured the young man, noting bitterly that yet again his concerns had been dismissed as unimportant.
>> "Great!" said the wise man and took off from his fingers a small ring with a beautiful gem.
>> "Take a horse and go to the market. I have to sell this ring as soon as possible to pay off a debt. Try to get as much as you can for it and, no matter what, do not agree to anything less than a gold coin. Go now and come back as soon as you can!"
>> The young man took the ring and rode away. When he got to the market, he offered the ring to the merchants and they looked it over with interest.
However, as soon as they heard that it will cost at least a gold coin, they lost all interest.
>> Some laughed right in his face, others simply turned away, and only one older merchant kindly explained that a gold coin is too high of a price for such a ring and the most he could get for it would be a silver coin or a bronze. When the young man heard that, he was distraught, remembering the wise man's directions to not take any less than a gold coin. He went through the entire market and offered the ring to over a hundred people, but nothing changed.
>> He got on his horse and rode back to the wise man. "I wasn't able to sell your ring," he said with sadness. "No one was willing to pay me a gold coin for it.
I could have gotten a silver coin, but that's not what this ring is worth."
"Now that's a very important point, my son!" said the wise man. "Before trying to sell a ring, you should find out what it's worth! And who can know better than a jeweller? Go to the jeweller and ask him what he will offer us for the ring. But no matter what he says, don't sell him the ring, just come back to me right away."
>> The young man jumped on his horse and rode to the jeweller. The jeweller carefully and patiently examined the ring, weighed it on his scale, then turned to the young man. "Tell your master that right now I can't give him more than 58 gold coins. But if he gives me some time, I'll buy it for 70, to compensate for the wait!"
>> "70 gold coins!" the young man exclaimed. He laughed, thanked the jeweller and raced back to the wise man. The wise man listened to the account of what happened and looked at the young man in the eyes. "Remember this, my son. You are like this ring - precious and unique! And only a real expert can appreciate your true worth. So why are you wasting your time going to random people to find out what it is?"

Now, what is the lesson from this parable? Just like the ring, before we throw ourselves out there for others to judge our value, we should determine and know with utmost confidence what we are worth inherently. Once we know ourselves, we can easily discern between prejudices and sincere feedback. Why does that matter?

### **Opinions are inevitable**
It is hard to stay away from society's judgements when we live in a world where being social is the norm. And frankly speaking, no matter what you think of yourselves, in most matters of practicality, people's opinion of you matters. It is almost inevitable to (in certain cases) to ignore the external voices that may even be based on prejudice or ignorance. And sometimes these voices may be true and based on facts.

Fact of the matter is this : we cannot and we should not run away from society. Even the most cynic ones of us will have to (reluctantly or otherwise) listen to opinions and perceptions. And sometimes, if we approve too much weightage to those opinions, we may as well feel insignificant, trapped or lost. But, like most things in life, we can learn to deal with perceptions, opinions, prejudices, feedbacks and disparagements in better and positive ways.

### **How can you be inevitable?**
When I ask myself this question, I am constantly reminded of this quote -

>> We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.

If we give it a deep thought, the inherent light (a metaphor to our capabilities or self-worth) should always be our guiding star. If we really know our own capabilities and have belief in them, we can always find solution to any given problem. On the other hand, if we put much trust in the inherent dark (a metaphor to our insecurities and hesitations), our guiding light will always be what others make us believe about ourselves.

And that's why, like the jeweller who could solely determine the worth of a gold ring, we have to become our own jeweller, expert and judge. Just like education begins at home, realization of self-worth begins in our own selves.

To become truly inevitable, we first need to become the person who we can put our most trust in. Then, the unjustified opinions, perceptions and prejudices will not have power over us; at least not enough to distract us from our path to a successful, purposeful and happy life. Of course, this is all easier said than done.

Albert Einstein once said -

>> Few people are capable of expressing with equanimity opinions which differ from the prejudices of their social environment. Most people are incapable of forming such opinions.

We should always remember that just as much as society influences us and our opinions, it influences the opinions of everyone that holds an opinion of us. While, undoubtedly, some opinions are helpful and we should accept and act on them as and when such cases arise, opinions based on no or insufficient data or logic need to be discarded at whim. That's just the way society works and that's probably the only way we can lead a more effective life.
