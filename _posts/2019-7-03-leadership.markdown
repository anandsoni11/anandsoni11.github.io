Let's begin with a question, shall we? What is leadership in its true sense and what does it mean to be a leader? Let's look for an answer in an inspiring tale told by a true leader, one of the most learned, loved and respected Presidents of India, Lt. Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam.

Felt a touch of inspiration? What did we learn? We learnt the simplest and probably the most accurate definition of leadership. Actually, I can end this story right here, but all of us need to understand this better and when this story actually ends, I hope we will all emerge enlightened on what leadership should actually be.


Recently, I had a vicarious experience in poor leadership. One of my best friends had to quit their job dealing with a *leader*. It forced me to think about the whole predicament and why it had to transpire the way it did. The more I thought about it, I realised some important things that I could not help but share. Why? Because I am sure there are others who deal with poor leadership and resulting predicaments regularly and in the worst case, even land their careers in jeopardy.

### **On managers and leaders - the illusion of leadership**\

Simon Sinek, a renowned author and motivational speaker defines the job of a leader, very simply, as not being in-charge but taking care of people in their charge. Confused? I should hope so. Let's look at how (in many corporate settings) *leaders* are made. As a beginner, in any field, one has a simple and clear job description and one's sole responsibility is to be good at it! You show up, work hard, get lots of training at whatever you are supposed to do. But, as you "grow", your responsibilities increase and at some point, you have to start being responsible for other people and their work. You go through cycles of promotions and one fine day (given you worked hard for it), you become a leader. But, do you really?

Sadly, no. Leadership is not something you acquire by promotions. It is a quality that can only be acquired by practice (of course there are innate leaders - exceptions). Unfortunately, this is not something that is taught at any school or in any corporate environment. And that's why, more often than not, we create managers not leaders. What's the difference? A manager knows only what he/she has been doing so far. No one taught them how to lead (a harsh reality) and hence they end up (micro) managing people they are in-charge of instead of leading them. Becoming a leader from a manager is a transition that takes both time and work. Unfortunately, some people never make this transition but live in an illusion of being a leader instead.

Let's consider my friend's example for a moment. Undoubtedly, a brilliant employee and still having career troubles. Why? The first thing that all of us (leaders or not) need to realise is that each and every person around us (friends, family, colleagues, strangers) have their own individual ways of life and of work. In more appropriate term, we call them individual personality traits. Now, a particular category of personality traits is frowned upon and looked down to even today in a lot of workplaces. Introversion. And to do that is simply ridiculous and disgusting. Among other things, I realised that, due to poor leadership, this particular trait combined with the desire of freedom to be real, costed my friend the most. Being sincere and skilful didn't matter at all.

Now, what should a good and real leader do dealing with so many individual traits and personalities? A straightforward (though not easily agreed upon) answer is that a true leader will always allow you to be yourself and give you avenues to grow while doing so. And that's not an easy job description.

> The true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own.

And that's exactly why it needs practice. The consequences of not practising and not developing leadership as a quality can be anything ranging from absurd to catastrophic. Because, what happens in such cases is that the *leader* believes that the outcome from people is more important than the people themselves. This means that the outcome has to be achieved no matter the personal cost that the *subservient* has to pay. This leads to micro managing. Discussions put forth for the desire of space and freedom are treated as arguments. In some cases (depending on the maturity of the leader), it even leads to personal grudges and inhospitality. And when the work environment grows that toxic, quitting looks like an easy choice. Though, I can't stress the fact enough that it can be really damaging for the person who has to make that choice.

> People are more than just an expendable resource.


### **What a true leader really is?**

Each and everyone of us makes mistakes. And we really should. That's the only way to learn. But, the prerequisite to learning from mistakes is accepting them as mistakes. Another trait of a true leader is knowing when they are wrong and showing no reluctance to accept it. Well, many *leaders* don't do that very well.

How do we define a leader? I think we can only do it if we first understand the virtues that make a leader. Some of the most important ones may be -

* empathy - leaders really care about and take care of their people. When people feel safe and respected, they take care of the leader and the organisation (taking their first steps towards leadership)

* vision - a leader is someone that people can follow! If you don't know why you do what you do, how will anyone else?

* grace of responsibility- if a leader, in stressful situations, is the one inducing fear and anxiety in employees, he/she is never going to have their trust. Leaders take responsibility

In the words of John Quincy Adams -

> If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader.

That sums it all! Leadership is neither a position nor an acquired privilege, it is what you are and what others see you to be. Period.
